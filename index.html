  The Columbia chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace announced on Dec. 9 an “emergency protest” on Barnard’s campus. The groups demanded that Barnard President Laura Rosenbury publicly call for a permanent ceasefire on behalf of the college.

  Weeks after the protest, students began receiving either “inquiry meeting” emails from Campus Life and Student Experience about their alleged involvement, or emails from Residential Life & Housing claiming they violated a policy that prohibits the placement of items on “window ledges.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We have information to suggest that you may have coordinated or participated in this event, thereby failing to comply with event policies and the directives of College officials, which is in violation with Barnard’s Code of Conduct,” one such email, obtained by Spectator, reads.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In a statement to Spectator, a Barnard College spokesperson wrote that the college “is confident in the integrity of its conduct review process, which prioritizes the dignity of our students and favors restorative and educational resolutions.”

  Students expressed confusion to Spectator as to how administrators identified them. Two email recipients said that they did not attend the Dec. 11 protest at all.

  “I think the students feel also confused about why they in particular were selected for hearings,” Frederick Neuhouser, GSAS ’80, GSAS ’88, a professor of German and philosophy who accompanied one student to their inquiry meeting, said. “And it feels to the students a little creepy, like, ‘Are we being spied on?’ It feels a little bit like Big Brother’s watching.”

  Maryam Iqbal, BC ’27, met Rosenbury and Grinage in October at a dinner to which she and other Arab and Muslim students were invited following student outcry over the administrative response to the Israel-Hamas war. At the dinner, Iqbal mentioned to Grinage and Rosenbury that she was a member of SJP.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “[That] was my first mistake,” Iqbal said. “Because now admin latches on to whoever they can get and makes an example out of them.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The inquiry meeting email sent out to students says that they “may have coordinated or participated” in the Dec. 11 unauthorized protest, but does not clarify which action each student is accused of.
</p>

  An incident report obtained by Spectator states that “the student(s) of concern were positively identified either by onsite administrative personnel or via social media images.”

  Cierra Martinez, BC ’24, received an email requesting an inquiry meeting but said she did not attend the Dec. 11 protest. She was working at her on-campus job at the time of the protest and was confused upon waking up to an inquiry meeting letter on Jan. 18, she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A Barnard junior, who spoke to Spectator under the condition of anonymity citing concerns of academic or financial consequences, also received an inquiry meeting request but said she did not attend the protest—she was only “passing through” while on a video call with her mom.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I literally was just walking by and I just stopped and stared for a couple seconds to show my mom, and then I walked away,” she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The student said that she was walking with her two roommates at the time, but they did not receive similar inquiry meeting emails.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  During her inquiry meeting, the student said she asked how administrators identified her, and the investigator conducting the meeting responded that a staff member reported her. The student said she told the investigator that she felt “singled out or targeted.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The investigator told her that she could not name the staff member and to file a Title IX incident report if she felt targeted, the student said. The student said she responded that she couldn’t file a report because she did not know the staff member’s name.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I literally am so paranoid walking through campus,” the student said. “I literally took my name tag off my door. Like, I’ve been so paranoid and just scared. … I don’t even like to raise my hand anymore in class when it comes to certain topics.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Izzy Lapidus, BC ’24, said that they had not seen Grinage’s Dec. 10 email and did not know “if the protest was authorized or unauthorized.” Lapidus said she attended the Dec. 11 protest after seeing “students starting to march and gather in the Barnard Quad.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It was an absolute shock to me when, on the second day of classes, I got an email with the subject line ‘inquiry meeting,’” Lapidus said.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Tomisin Fasosin, BC ’25, said that the investigator told her during her inquiry meeting that she was identified by an administrator who saw her at the Dec. 11 protest. Fasosin said that at the meeting, she was asked if she knew that “it was ‘wrong’ to be” at the protest. She was told that if she were to attend another “unauthorized event,” she would “go straight into a conduct meeting,” Fasosin said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Martinez said that even though she didn’t attend the protest, she was concerned that the inquiry meetings could put students at risk of losing their financial aid.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I’m on financial aid. And like, literally every year it’s like a battle to get enough financial aid,” Martinez said. “When my family heard about this, about me getting a hearing, they were really, really concerned because it’s like, let this be the reason why I can’t get my degree in the last semester.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Nine students who spoke to Spectator were told that they were in violation of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rnbG361DGh9cxqUbB7vEpMqWFKsiUqPFg01q0rZ6MTE/edit">Barnard College campus events and approval policy</a>, which outlines rules for organizing and gaining administrative approval to host events—including demonstrations and protests—on Barnard’s campus. The policy requires students and faculty to submit requests for public demonstrations, categorized as “Events with Resources,” at least “28 calendar days prior to the proposed Event date.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Barnard is committed to ensuring that students have access to events and speakers that represent a diverse range of thought, and the time restrictions are in place to ensure availability of resources, including the staffing of our community safety team,”a Barnard College spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The event policy was put into effect on Nov. 2, according to a version of the policy published via a Google document on the <a href="https://barnard.edu/events-management/information-for-protestors">Information for Protesters</a> webpage, and drew concerns from faculty who told Spectator that Barnard administration unilaterally changed the policies without their consultation.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “These time restrictions have long been in place at Barnard,” the spokesperson wrote. “Barnard is working with our community to review and improve our existing policies, with a particular focus on ensuring that we continue to protect freedom of expression and the safety and well-being of our students.”
</p>

  In late October, Barnard took down a “Solidarity with Palestine” statement from the women’s, gender, and sexuality studies departmental web page before altering the college’s political activity policy in November and implementing new administrative controls over what faculty, students, and staff can say using college resources.

  Spectator spoke to two students who received emails from Residential Life requiring that they attend an “administrative conduct meeting” concerning their alleged violation of a Residential Life rule regarding “Defenestration or items placed on window ledges.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the email, Barnard cited a New York City ordinance prohibiting “placing articles of any kind … outside the window, as well as throwing or projecting anything out of a window.” However, New York City <a href="https://zr.planning.nyc.gov/article-ii/chapter-2/22-332">code</a> states that hanging “flags, banners or pennants” is “permitted without limitation” in “community facilities,” which Barnard dormitories are zoned under.

  Katherine Franke, BC ’81, a professor of law, said that she believes Barnard created this new rule regarding students’ right to hang flags outside their dorm windows and applied it retroactively against students. She said Barnard itself violates this new rule because it hangs Barnard College flags outside of Barnard Hall.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There was no violation that said that at the time, December of last year, so what they’re doing is they’re making up a new rule and putting it into the Residential Life handbook,” Franke said. “And then applying it retroactively to students who they, I guess, are alleging that they hung flags outside of their windows.”

  Abu El-Haj emphasized that she is in steadfast support of all speech on college campuses and that the restriction of any speech “is not acceptable.” She said that the issue at hand is the fact that inquiry meetings and administrative pursuit of disciplinary action against students are “not content-neutral enforcement.”

  “I really don’t care what these students’ politics are,” Abu El-Haj said. “I don’t understand the way the administrations have been responding. It seems overly disciplinary, it seems overly cruel. And are we really not going to allow civil protests on campuses?”

  Barnard faculty sent a letter on Jan. 19 to Rosenbury, Grinage, and Barnard Provost and Dean of Faculty Linda Bell calling for the cancellation of all planned disciplinary action concerning the Dec. 11 unauthorized protest. As of Jan. 21, 106 Barnard faculty had signed onto the letter.

  “We write concerning the disciplinary proceedings against nearly two dozen Barnard students, proceedings which accuse them of attending and, in some cases, organizing an ‘unauthorized protest,’” the letter reads. “While the summonses issued to students may be supported by specific college rules, the college’s unprecedented decision to enforce these rules in a way that adversely affects students with one particular set of political beliefs undermines any collective sense of transparency, process, procedure, or fairness.”

  “The process is fair and unbiased, and Dean Grinage and her team consistently respect the individual dignity of each student and the educational mission of the College as a whole,” Rosenbury wrote. “To that end, our process favors informal educational resolutions whenever possible.”

  With growing divisions between Barnard’s administration and its faculty and students, Becher voiced concerns about the effects of the administration’s clamping down on campus speech and expression.

  “I’m worried either that this movement towards repression of speech is going to work and … many of us who care to be otherwise will leave,” Becher said. “And the school will be populated by students and faculty administrators who are willing to be silent, or don’t have any other choice, need to keep their job, and are willing to be silent under this kind of regime.”

  Rosenbury will be inaugurated as Barnard’s ninth president on Friday, ushering in a new era of leadership at the college and symbolically marking the turbulent beginning of Barnard’s next chapter. Three pro-Palestinian student groups—Columbia University Apartheid Divest, SJP, and JVP—called on students to “boycott” Friday’s pomp and circumstance in a Jan. 26 Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2lJacCyMHd/?img_index=1">post</a>.

  The groups demanded that Rosenbury “stop her blatant censorship of both faculty and students, which has caused Barnard to be put on watch by the NYCLU for violation of academic freedom.”

  Franke, who attended Barnard in the late ’70s and early ’80s, said that the administration tolerated and allowed protests when she was an undergraduate as aligning with the university’s purpose to promote debate and free speech.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “They’re making enormous mistakes in how they’re disciplining students and they ought to just decide to dismiss all of these complaints against the students from last semester for all of the irregularities in their enforcement,” Franke said. “As a Barnard alum, I’m actually quite shocked and disappointed in Barnard’s administration and how they’re handling this.”

  “If we are an institution that is dedicated to free inquiry, to academic work, to the production of new knowledge, then we should be interested in supporting freedom of expression, basic First Amendment rights, as well as academic freedom,” Jakobsen said.

  “I think the whole point of having a college and a university is for the sake of the pursuit of knowledge, unfettered pursuit of knowledge,” Carman said. “And that means robust communication, and only limiting speech when it’s absolutely necessary.”

  The students said they were told that if they attend another unauthorized protest or have another accusation filed against them, they could be called to a formal conduct meeting, the next step in the disciplinary process that could lead to more severe consequences.
